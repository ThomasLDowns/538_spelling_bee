    "   This question is actually fairly easy to intuit. At the end of the first game, you have seen 6 out of the 30 cards. What the question is then asking is what are the odds you can draw three <u>more</u> cards that you haven't essentially picking 3 out of the pool of 24 as-yet-unseen cards. This can be easily shown by working out the odds of drawing each card sequentially without replacement. The odds of the first would be 24/30, the second 23/29, and the third 22/28."

    "Here is the meat of the simulation... we provide the number of trials wanted and the order of the spellers for each trial. Then, we create a zeroes array to collect the winnrs of each trial. During each trial, we create a list of spellers in the specified order. Each speller is identified by the percentage of the dictionary they have memorized. While the number of spellers is 2 or more, cycle through the list. If the speller gets the word right (the function returns true) continue, if they get it false remove the speller and continue the rotation. Do this until there is only one speller remaining. At this point, increment the results by that spellers percentage of knowledge mod 90 (0 through 9 from weakest to strongest speller), then continue with the next cycle. Once done, return the final results array."

The other obvious difference is that the weakest speller has a much better chance of winning if going last instead of going first. This conclusion makes sense (the weak speller has a greater chance of other, stronger spellers being disqualified before he goes), but I have no idea why going last would be to the detriment of the strongest speller. Interesting..."
